I'm Maliny, a Master of Business Analytics student at Monash University, graduating in late 2024. My academic and personal journey is anchored in a passion for understanding our world and environmental impact through data.

Curiosity drives me to learn and explore; I've developed skills in R, Python, and recently, a declarative language called MiniZinc. I'm keen on opportunities to apply my data analysis skills, especially in areas promoting environmental sustainability or leveraging data for positive change.
